# WrikeAnalyser
View the project tree of Wrike backups

Put `folders.json` and `tasks.json` in the same folder as `WrikeAnalyser.py` and run it. It will print a tree view of all folders and tasks.

Tested on Python 3.7

Future plans
------------

  * Convert the project tree into a filesystem tree with all tasks as `.html` files
